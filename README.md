SALES ANALYSIS REPORT

Data Segmentation
Segmentation by Country, Region, and Market:
Create separate visualizations for each segment to illustrate sales performance.
Step 2: Analyze Shipping Modes
Shipping Analysis:
Visualize the percentage of shipping based on different ship modes (e.g., standard, express).
Create a pie chart or bar chart to show the distribution.
Step 3: Sales Analysis by Geography
Sales by City, State, Region, and Market:
Use bar charts or heat maps to illustrate sales figures across different cities, states, regions, and markets.
Provide tables summarizing the sales data for each category.
Step 4: Create Tables
Tables for Visualizations:
Generate tables summarizing the sales data by country, region, and market.
Include relevant metrics such as total sales, number of transactions, and average sale per transaction.
Step 5: Interactive Sales Report
Dashboard Creation:
Use tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Google Data Studio to create an interactive dashboard.
Include filters for stakeholders to explore the data by different dimensions (e.g., time period, country, ship mode).
